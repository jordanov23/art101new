<h1> This is Jordan's ART101 website homepage </h1>
<div id="introduction">
<h2> Welcome! </h2>
    <p>
    I'm Jordan Ramey (he/him) a writer, traveler, and actor based in Felton California.
    I currently work at Roaring Camp Railroad in Felton at the kitchen, but in my spare time,
    I perform community theater, travel a lot, and aspire to make a living as a screenwriter and playwright.
    So far in life, I have traveled to Hawaii, Alaska, spent three months studying abroad in Florence, Italy, Spain, Austria, and studied humanities for a month in Paris, France, but I'm not stopping there!
